Create a professional, visually modern website tools app with Python backend (Flask or FastAPI) and beautiful frontend (HTML/CSS/Tailwind). Build the following 3 fully working tools with real-time result output and clean UI. Include animations, icons, colorful cards, and copy buttons.

üìÇ TOOL 1: Safe Browsing Checker
- Input: Website URL
- Backend: Use Google's Safe Browsing API (or mock API for demo)
- Python logic checks if the site is blacklisted/malicious/phishing
- Output: Color-coded result (Green = Safe, Red = Unsafe, Orange = Suspicious)
- Show threat type, checked URL, threat source
- Optional: Tooltip on threat types (phishing, malware, etc.)
- Copy Result button
- Clean card layout with status badge (Safe/Unsafe)

üìÇ TOOL 2: IP Geolocation Finder
- Input: Any IP address or domain
- Backend: Use free API like ipinfo.io or ip-api.com (or simulate)
- Python fetches: country, city, ISP, timezone, coordinates, org
- Output: Map preview (optional iframe), info table with icons
- "Get My IP" shortcut button
- Copy all result option
- Colorful location card with flag and IP details

üìÇ TOOL 3: Domain Age Checker
- Input: Domain name (e.g., example.com)
- Python uses `whois` module or API to fetch:
  - Creation date, update date, expiry date, total age in years/months
- Output: Beautiful timeline card with creation to expiry line
- Show domain registrar + status (active, expired, soon to expire)
- Copy result or export to PDF button
- Show age visually like: ‚Äúüïí 7 Years, 2 Months old‚Äù

üé® UI REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Tailwind CSS or beautiful custom CSS
- Each tool in its own colorful card with rounded corners, icons, shadows
- Mobile-first layout
- Include dark mode toggle
- Add animated loader while data is being fetched
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

‚öôÔ∏è TECH STACK:
- Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS or Tailwind (optional React if needed)
- Backend: Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- Modular folder structure, separate Python script per tool
- Fully working Replit-compatible code

üìà SEO & UX:
- Each tool should be SSR-rendered
- Include meta title, meta description in the HTML head
- Tool output must be clean, copyable, and crawlable
- Breadcrumbs at top of each tool page
- Add sitemap-friendly URLs for each tool

‚úÖ OUTPUT:
- A fully working, mobile-responsive, fast-loading website tools app with:
  - Safe Browsing Checker
  - IP Geolocation Finder
  - Domain Age Checker
- Beautiful design, real API or simulated API connection, ready for live deployment
